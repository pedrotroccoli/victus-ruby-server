# Victus

Victus is the backend API for a habit tracking application designed to help people build lasting habits and improve their daily routines.

## What is Victus?

Victus empowers users to:

- **Track daily habits** — Create and monitor recurring habits with flexible scheduling
- **See the bigger picture** — Visualize progress over weeks, months, and years
- **Understand patterns** — Discover correlations between habits and mood over time
- **Build habit hierarchies** — Organize habits into parent-child relationships for complex routines
- **Monitor mood** — Log emotional states alongside habit completion to reveal long-term trends

## Why Long-Term Tracking Matters

Most habit apps focus on streaks and daily check-ins. Victus goes further by helping users understand their journey over time:

- **Historical insights** — See how your habits evolved across months and years
- **Mood-habit correlation** — Discover which habits actually improve your well-being
- **Trend analysis** — Identify seasonal patterns, weekly rhythms, and gradual improvements
- **Progress visualization** — Transform raw data into meaningful stories about personal growth

The goal isn't just to check boxes — it's to build a personal dataset that reveals what truly works for you.

## The Victus Ecosystem

## Philosophy

Victus follows a "small steps, big changes" philosophy. Daily habits are the fundamental unit of change, but their true value emerges over time. By combining simple daily tracking with powerful long-term analytics, Victus helps users see beyond the day-to-day grind and understand the trajectory of their personal growth.

Your data tells a story. Victus helps you read it.
